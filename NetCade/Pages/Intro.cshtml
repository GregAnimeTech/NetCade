                    <br>Urban Legends.  A type of Desire.  “Was real” becomes a Rumor.
                    This kind of thinking was not strange to the world.  Since ancient times, a rumor was likely the accidental product of astronomical probability.
                    Looking from this way of thinking, the world was not chaotic, but orderly.
                    By imagining out a value of this world.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Being something that was born from earnest Desire.
                    Illuminate the skies, there are truths mistaken for legends.
                    In the end, nobody knows if they were true.  Do not be mistaken, this does not mean that the urban legends are true.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now then, how did this Urban Legend come about?
                    Ah... that's right, it all started out as any ordinary Rumor.
                    And that Rumor is ...
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In a past that was far too long ago.  The Old Deus competed with the ultimate prize of being the supreme, sole God on the line and started a war, along with their servants and created beings.
                    This war lasted for a long, long time.  So long it felt numbing.  There was no land that was not stained with blood, and cries of agony had never ceased to echo through the skies.
                    The civilized races hated each other, slaughtered each other, and continued to repeat their countless killings.  The Elves had small villages as their bases, and they cast magic to hunt their enemies.
                    The Dragonkin used their bodies for killing purposes, and the were beasts devoured their prey like animals.
                    The barren land that was already swallowed by the sunset was also engulfed by the deeper darkness due to the wars waged between the old Deus.
                    The Demon Lords and their allied monsters that were created by the Phantasma  went rampant and dominated the land.  In this kind of world, it did not matter how many nobles, beauties, or warriors there were.
                    Humans were just an insignificant existence.  They had to bet their lives on building their countries and forming clans just to survive.
                    The legendary hero who could be hailed by the bards did not appear and just like that, it was a blood-stained era.  This was a story that was far longer and older than the skies, seas, and land called the ‘Disconnect Board’.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, the war they thought would continue for eternity suddenly ended.  The skies, seas, land, and even the stars that filled the skies.
                    They lost the will to continue this unending, weary war where they died needlessly and without enjoying life.  And just like that, at this point, the Old Deus with the most amount of power left sat on the only throne for a sole God.
                    And so, this Deus who had been watching from the sidelines all this while.  Abstaining from the war from the beginning till the end.  The Deus sat on the throne, looking at the devastation on the land around him.
                    He declared to all the people roaming on the land.
                    <br />
                    "—To everyone, who used up all extremes of strength, violence, desperation, and death.  Show me proof that you, who built towers of corpses, are civilized beings as you so claim."
                    'What is the difference between you and the ‘unintelligent beasts’ ?  All the races unanimously said that there was no need to prove their own intelligence.  But, in front of this barren and abandoned world, this discourse was too empty.
                    Ultimately, there was no answer that was accepted by God.  God said.  —From this piece of Heaven, I command that there will be no plundering or bloodshed.  Those words became an Oath, becoming the absolute unchanging law of the world.
                    From that day onwards, war disappeared from the world.  But the population that considered themselves rational sent complaints to God in unison.  Even if war has disappeared, conflict still exists.
                    God said, in that case “Those of the Sixteen Races that claim to be the most intelligent creatures.  Those who use all extremes of your reason, intelligence, ability, and financial resources.
                    Build towers of wisdom, and through that thou shalt prove thine own intelligence”.  God took out sixteen chess pieces and laughed maliciously.  Thus, the Ten Oaths  were born, and war disappeared from the world.
                    All disputes were resolved by Games.  That was the law of the sole God, and that God's name was TET .
                    The Ten Oaths are 1 All bloodshed, war, and pillage are forbidden throughout the world.  2 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.  3 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of equal value.
                    4 Unless contrary to "Three", the game content and the things wagered do not matter.  5 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.  6 "As per the Oath", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
                    7 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.  8 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.  9 The above rules are unconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name of God.
                    10 Everyone should get along while playing games.
